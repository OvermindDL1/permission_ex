# PermissionEx

A simple Permission system for Elixir.  Created to be used with Phoenix but has
no requirement or any real integration with it as this is designed to be
entirely generic.

## Installation

[Available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/permission_ex), the package can be
installed by:

  1. Add permission_ex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
